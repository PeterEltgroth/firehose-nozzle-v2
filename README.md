## Connecting

There are two ways to connect get data from the v2 API.

* [Reverse Log Proxy Gateway](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/master/docs/rlp_gateway.md)
* [Reverse Log Proxy](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/tree/develop/jobs/reverse_log_proxy)

Each is described below. Using the Gateway is the easier path to building a nozzle.

## Building a Nozzle Using RLP Gateway (Recommended Path)

The RLP Gateway adds:
* The ability to deploy applications as a nozzle
* Eliminating the need for mTLS
* Does not require any Loggregator specific libraries to process data

The gateway was released [in PCF version 2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#-loggregator-v2-api-is-readable-through-rlp-gateway)

### Authentication & Testing
To create a UAA user that can access the data, use
the [UAA CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/uaa/uaa-user-management.html).

Create the user:

```bash
uaac target https://uaa.sys.<pcf system domain> --skip-ssl-validation
uaac token client get admin -s <admin client secret>
uaac client add my-v2-nozzle \
  --name my-v2-nozzle \
  --secret <my-v2-nozzle client secret> \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities logs.admin
```

To manually get a token:

```bash
uaac token client get v2-nozzle-test -s <my-v2-nozzle client secret>
uaac context
``` 

The RLP Gateway data can be tested with just `curl`. To view the 
data (newline delimited JSON payloads), copy the token and run:
```bash
export token=<my-v2-nozzle token from context>
curl -k -H "Authorization: $token" 'https://log-stream.sys.<pcf system domain>/v2/read?counter'
```

## Building a Nozzle Directly Connecting to RLP

Communication is done directly to the RLP over HTTP/2.
This endpoint is discoverable via
[its BOSH LINK](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/blob/v105.1/jobs/reverse_log_proxy/spec#L21-L25)

The link is shared in a PCF deployment:
```yaml
...
provides: |
  reverse_log_proxy: {as: reverse_log_proxy, shared: true}
...
```

* In a full runtime deployment, this component is on the `loggregator_trafficcontroller` vm and listens on `:8082`
* In the small footprint PAS, it is deployed on the `control` vm and listens on `:8086`

Authentication is done via mTLS. The mTLS connection is authenticated by connecting with a certificate signed by 
the [Ops Manager Root CA](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#-certificate-types).

For development, the nozzle author can manually generate a certificate signed by OpsMan's root CA
[using its certificate API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#certificates)
and the [om tool](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om):

```
om -t https://pcf.example.com -k -u ${user} -p ${pwd} \
    curl -x POST -p /api/v0/certificates/generate -d '{ "domains": ["*.example.com", "*.sub.example.com"] }'
```

The domain used in the certificate does _not_ matter.

To get the
[root certificate from Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#-certificate-types),
download in advanced settings:
Admin -> Settings -> Advanced -> Download Root CA Cert

As mentioned above, the communication uses http/2.
In a PCF environment (rather than [cfdev](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cfdev)
or some other tooling where the component would be directly accessible), 
one way to develop locally is to setup a ssh tunnel through OpsMan:

```
ssh -i [path to ssh private key] \
  -L 9000:[IP of loggregator_trafficcontroller or control VM]:[8082 or 8086] \
  ubuntu@opsman.example.com
```

`src/local_dev.template.sh` is a sample script that will run the nozzle, once 
the certificates are generated and put on disk.

## Tile
The `tile` directory packages the gateway version of the nozzle as an app deployed on the platform.

Build is done via [PCF Tile Generator](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/tile-generator/)
